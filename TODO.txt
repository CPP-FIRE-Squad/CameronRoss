luminosity = sim.particles['star']['mass'] ???

After I run tests, what is the goal of the incorporating the Jeans Equation?


cd /scratch/projects/GalaxiesOnFIRE/core_no_md
Look for these 3 sims and see if any output exist at:
    m12m_r7100
    m12i_r7100
    m12f_r7100

Look into ways to transfer huge files from user to user

Work with Austin to try and run all these simulations in rockstar



New features
    Replace 3DR w/ 2DR
    Capture 1 kpc sphere of all the masses around a star(gas, star, dm)
    Get the velocity dispersion of all the stars within the sphere whose radius is equal to the stars radius
        standard deviation of vz fopr every star in the sphere
        only train with stars who have more than 10 stars in the sphere
